	.bmp  - Supports up to 32-bit color (4,294,967,296 colors).
	.gif  - Supports its own palette of up to 8-bit color (256 colors) chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space.
	.jpeg -	Supports up to 24-bit color (16,777,216 colors).
	.png  - Supports up to 48-bit color (281,474,976,710,656 colors).

4.	What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?

5.	What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
